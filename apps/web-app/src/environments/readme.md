This solution uses [environment variables](https://angular.dev/tools/cli/environments) that are hard-coded during build, as the build and deploy step are bundled.

If you want to separate the build and deploy steps (more suitable for applications that are deployed to multiple environments, as then you only build once), the config file should be loaded during runtime. A way to do it is [described here](https://angular.love/dynamic-configuration-leveraging-app-initializer). Keep in mind that the browser caches files based on their URIs, so to make sure that after a new build and deployment the browser actually reloads the file from the server, you should append a new guid as a query parameter to your fetch request (like config.json?guid=random guid). For this you have to do build time GUID generation and something to replace the query param in the file with this generated id. (If you want to avoid getting rid of caching altogether.)
